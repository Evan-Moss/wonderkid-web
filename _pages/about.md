page-title: What is Wonderkid?
---

Wonderkid is an online magazine telling curious sports stories often with a focus on data. We believe that through data science and statistics, we can tell richer sports stories. Sport is inherently statistical and these statistics are usually understandable and useful. Not all our stories will be told through data, but the hope is that many will.

Wonderkid articles __do not__ necessarily need to use data analysis even though many of them will. The only condition is that a Wonderkid article must tell an interesting story about sports. If you want to tell this story through the use of data, then great! But this is not essential.  

## Coding/Data Sources

If you are interested in how any of the data science aspects of the content works, or where we got our data from, try looking at the [Wonderkid Github](https://github.com/{{ site.social_media.github}}). Many of our articles have all the code needed to produce the results. If you don't find what you are looking for there, get in touch and we will try to help you.
